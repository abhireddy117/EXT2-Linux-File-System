# EduEXT

Implemented a fully functional EXT2 file system in C that can create, mount, and manage EXT2 partition images and access files just like a real Linux system. Recreated all the key low-level EXT2 components and data structures from scratch, including inodes, bitmaps, descriptors, etc. Uses Linux system calls for seamless integration and operation.

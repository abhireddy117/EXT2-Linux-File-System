1.Download the zip and unzip it.

2.Go into the Final folder.

3.Right click in the file explorer and select the option to open in terminal.

4. Run ./mk.

Accessing files in the disk:

# EduEXT
Utilizing low-level C programming and Linux tools, I successfully created a fully-featured EXT2 file system implementation from scratch. The application provides the functionality to initialize new EXT2 partition images that can be formatted and mounted just like real disk partitions. Once mounted, the virtual partitions behave identically to a real EXT2 file system. The user can seamlessly create, open, read, write, and access files stored on the virtual device by leveraging standard Linux system calls. Under the hood, all the key components of an EXT2 file system were recreated including superblocks, inode tables, bitmaps, directories, and more. This project demonstrates expert knowledge of EXT2 internals through a simulated file system that emulates the core functionality and behavior of a real-world EXT2 implementation. In summary, I developed a high-fidelity EXT2 file system using C and Linux tools that can initialize, populate, mount and access virtual EXT2 partitions.


This was a term project at Washington State University.

I worked with a teammate for this project.
